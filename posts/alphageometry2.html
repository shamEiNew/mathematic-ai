                    <p>For decades, researchers have pursued the "holy grail" of AI: systems that can reason and solve complex mathematical problems. While large language models have made significant strides, they often struggle with the fundamental understanding of geometric objects and their interactions. This challenge led to the development of AlphaGeometry (AG1), a neuro-symbolic system designed to tackle Euclidean geometry problems at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level.</p>

                    <p>AG1 combined a neural language model for creative insights with a symbolic engine using a formal language and deduction rules. It was trained on 100 million synthetically generated examples and achieved a solving rate of 54% on IMO geometry problems from 2000 to 2024. However, AG1 had limitations in its domain-specific language, the efficiency of its symbolic engine, and the capacity of its language model.</p>

                    <p>Enter AlphaGeometry2 (AG2). This significantly improved version has now surpassed an average gold medalist in solving Olympiad geometry problems, achieving an 84% solving rate on IMO geometry problems from 2000-2024. This represents a significant leap forward in AI's ability to handle challenging mathematical reasoning tasks.</p>

                    <h3>Key Enhancements in AG2</h3>

                    <h4>Expanded Domain Language</h4>
                    <p>AG2's language can now handle more complex problems, including those involving the movement of objects and linear equations of angles, ratios, and distances. It also supports non-constructive problems and includes new predicates for finding angles and ratios. This expansion has significantly increased the language's coverage of IMO geometry problems from 66% to 88%. AG2 also introduces predicates for diagram checks and handling overlapping points.</p>

                    <h4>Stronger and Faster Symbolic Engine</h4>
                    <p>The Deductive Database Arithmetic Reasoning (DDAR) symbolic engine is a core component. AG2 features a faster and more robust engine with an optimized rule set, better handling of "double points" (different names, same coordinates), and a C++ implementation that is over 300 times faster than its predecessor. The improved algorithm makes searching for similar triangles and cyclic quadrilaterals more efficient.</p>

                    <h4>Enhanced Language Model</h4>
                    <p>AG2 leverages a more powerful language model based on the Gemini architecture. This model is trained on a significantly larger and more diverse dataset, orders of magnitude larger than AG1's. AG2 explores different training setups, including training from scratch, fine-tuning math-specialized Gemini models, and multimodal training with diagram images as input.</p>

                    <h4>Advanced Novel Search Algorithm</h4>
                    <p>AG2 introduces the Shared Knowledge Ensemble of Search Trees (SKEST). This algorithm runs multiple search trees with different configurations in parallel, allowing them to share knowledge about facts they've proved. This knowledge sharing mechanism is crucial for exploring a wider range of auxiliary construction strategies and accelerating the search process.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>In conclusion, AlphaGeometry2 represents a significant advancement in AI's ability to solve complex mathematical problems, specifically in the domain of Olympiad geometry. Its combination of an enhanced language model, a more powerful symbolic engine, an expanded language, and a novel search algorithm has led to gold-medalist level performance.</p>
